      Nestled in a romantic setting of riverside and charming bridges, Prague is renowned for being one of the most well-preserved cities in Europe. Often tagged as 'the City of a Hundred Spires', the city's skyline is dotted with historical domed structures and plenty of remarkable medieval church spires. The Old Town with its archaic squares and cobblestoned streets adds charm to this already beautiful city laid out according to the 1000-years old plan. Other than being brimming with architectural wonders, Prague is also a significant political, cultural and commercial hub continuing its legacy from the past. The historical centre of Prague, a total area of 866 hectares was declared as the UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage Register in 1992 and thus drawing tourists in large number from all around the globe. With art spilling all around, aroma of delicious food and drinks wafting off the cafes, the strings of classical music vibrating through the air, Prague will enchant you with its beauty.
