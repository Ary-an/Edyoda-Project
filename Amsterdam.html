          Amsterdam took it's time to come into the European tourism scene, always living under the shadow of other major cities such as Milan, Paris and London. However, once the true potential of the city was unlocked, it became one of the most popular holiday destinations for tourists coming into the continent and European citizens as a whole. The city had mostly gained popularity in the early years for its red light district, for its nightlife and a relaxed attitude towards soft drugs. Now, after the renovations of the famous Museumplein, which houses the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh museum and the Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, the city has regained its enchanting artistic heritage, and has truly become a world-class destination for museums.

        Ditch everything and rent a bike, have a picnic in the Vondelpark, go shopping in the streets of Jordaan, cruise in Amsterdam's picturesque canals, eat popular street foods such as the herring at the herring carts, visit the historical house of Anne Frank, or go beer tasting at de Gooyer's Brouwerij 'Tij (and the tons of microbreweries on offer throughout the city). The list of things you can do in this city is truly endless. Amsterdam is an absolute must visit on your European itinerary!
