      "Welcome to the fantasy of a dreamy island with utmost perfectional beauty"- This is how the pictures of Bora Bora entice you for a vacation. A part of French Polynesia, this magical island has some of the most beautiful sights to behold- a tropical island sorrounded by the amazing blue lagoon and coral reefs, accompanied by small islets (Motus) scattered around Bora Bora.

        Crowned by the blue lagoon,Bora Bora is a heavenly paradise for people longing for a relaxing vacation amidst natural beauty, and not to forget newly-weds who're looking for a private romantic setting for honeymooning. If you're thinking Bora Bora is just for some sun-soaking and a luxurious getaway, you are absolutely right, NOT. Bora Bora has a lot more to offer apart from its indulging over-water and beach-side resorts. When you get slightly bored of sunbathing and your supercool tan starts looking like burnt skins, you can always turn to some great adventures for an extraordinary experience. There are a couple of underwater activities that also allow you to interact with the enigmatic marine life.
